## For the reviewer

Review: <about N minutes (small | medium | large), from `ada-size`; raised for a fragile area, and why>
Actual review time: <the reviewer fills this in, so the estimates can be tuned>

Three to five lines: where the review is (the changed logic, and any fragile area, by file and
function), what is cheap to skim, and what wasn't verified.

## What changed and why

## Built

Files touched, and any decision that wasn't in the brief.

## Reviewed

Rules checked (STANDARDS.md numbers), what was found, how it was resolved.

## Tested

- Tests supplied (S29), by Definition of Done item: unit / PressTest / functional script, with
  paths. Any item without one, and why:
- Verified (with the clock time for anything date-related):
- Not verified, and why:
- Failed and left: none
- Run record (copied from TEST-REPORT.md: clock time, site, IDs used, commits before and after, row counts, checks not run and why):

## Manual test steps

Numbered steps a person can follow in the browser to check the change by hand: where to go,
what to do, what they should see. Say when a step only works at certain times (e.g. after 12:00
on a Friday, or on a Sunday). "None" if there is nothing to check by hand, and why.
